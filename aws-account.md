# Setting Up Your AWS Account

Here's a step-by-step guide to setting up your AWS account:

## 1. Visit the AWS Website

Begin your journey by visiting the [AWS homepage](https://aws.amazon.com/).

## 2. Click on "Create an AWS Account"

Look for the "Sign In to the Console" button in the top-right corner. Click on it and then click on "Create an AWS account."

## 3. Follow the Registration Process

- Fill in the required information, including your email address and a strong password.
- Choose an account name, which will serve as your unique identifier in the AWS realm.
- Provide your contact information and agree to the terms and conditions.

## 4. Payment Information

- Add payment information to your account. AWS offers a Free Tier with limited resources for the first 12 months, allowing you to explore and experiment without incurring charges.

## 5. Identity Verification

- Verify your identity through a phone call or text message.

## 6. Welcome to AWS!

Congratulations! You've successfully set up your AWS account.
