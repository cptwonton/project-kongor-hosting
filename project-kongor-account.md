# Creating Your Project Kongor Account

To prepare for hosting Heroes of Newerth servers on AWS, you need to have a Project Kongor account. Here are the steps to create one:

## 1. Visit [Kongor.Online](https://kongor.online)

Navigate to the official Project Kongor website: [https://kongor.online](https://kongor.online).

## 2. Click on "Register"

Find the "Register" button located on the top-right corner of the page. Click on it to begin the registration process.

## 3. Enter a Valid Email

- Enter a unique email address, adhering to the following constraints:
  - Must be from a commonly available domain like Gmail or Hotmail.
  - Each Project Kongor account must have a unique email, so you cannot reuse an email that's already associated with another account.
  - No aliasing allowed

## 4. Follow the Email Verification Link

- Once you've entered a valid email, check your inbox for a verification email from Project Kongor.
- Click on the verification link to confirm your email and proceed with the registration process.

## 5. Create a New Username

- After email verification, you will be prompted to create a new and unique username.
- Choose a username that has not been used before.

## 6. Set a Secure Password

- Set a strong and secure password for your Project Kongor account.

## 7. Note Your Credentials

- After completing the registration process, take note of your username and password.
- These credentials will be necessary later when configuring and connecting to your Heroes of Newerth servers on AWS.

Congratulations! You now have a Project Kongor account ready for hosting on AWS.
